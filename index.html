            <h2>Overview of Workshop</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify">Ensuring robust security and privacy measures within Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled applications has become paramount in our increasingly interconnected world. The proliferation of IoT devices, ranging from smart home gadgets to industrial sensors, has introduced new vulnerabilities and risks that must be addressed to safeguard sensitive data and critical infrastructure. Enhancing security and privacy in IoT-enabled applications involves implementing comprehensive strategies that encompass encryption protocols, authentication mechanisms, and secure data transmission protocols. Additionally, addressing challenges such as device authentication, data encryption, and access control is crucial to mitigate potential threats and safeguard user privacy. Moreover, as IoT technology continues to evolve and integrate into various aspects of daily life and industrial operations, the need for robust security and privacy measures becomes even more critical. Future applications of IoT technology hold immense potential for enhancing efficiency, automation, and convenience across various sectors, including healthcare, transportation, and agriculture. However, to fully realize the benefits of IoT innovation, it is imperative to proactively address security and privacy concerns. By developing and implementing advanced security protocols, leveraging encryption techniques, and fostering collaboration between stakeholders, the potential of IoT-enabled applications to drive positive societal impact while safeguarding sensitive data and privacy can be maximized.</p>
